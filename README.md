# File-Encrypter-and-Decrypter
This script can destroy your pc.
So please use it only in a new folder.
Make sure to put both files in that folder.
Make a .txt file and write something on it.
Then run voldemort.py and see how the file is encrypted.
Use decrypt.py to decrypt the encrypted file.
Please don't run voldemort.py two times.
So the key to decrypt the file will be change and decrypt.py will not work.

THIS ONLY WORKS IN KALI LINUX OS.


PLEASE DON'T USE THIS FOR ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES..............................
